# titan_x52

a script to enhance the usage of the Saitek/Logitech X52(pro) through TITAN on consoles

## Version 1.31:

This version had been completely rebuilt based on the change of HID input on GTuner, and also incorporates cross-platform capabilities (XB/PS).

As such, it does introduce a breaking change (i know, i violate rules of semantic versioning here to the favour of sticking to GTuner versions) from previous, as the combos on PS will change from Touchpad to e.g.: L3+R3+Digital_Pad_UP.

This combos are future-proof, any further updates will only introduce more comboÂ´s of that kind, but existing ones will change no more.
