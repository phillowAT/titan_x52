## Version 1.31:

This version had been completely rebuilt based on the change of HID input on GTuner, and also incorporates cross-platform capabilities (XB/PS).

As such, it does introduce a breaking change from previous, as the combos on PS will change from Touchpad to e.g.: L3+R3+Digital_Pad_UP.

This combos now are future-proof, any further updates will only introduce more comboÂ´s of that kind, but existing ones wont change anymore.
